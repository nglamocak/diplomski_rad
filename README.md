Data is cleaned from data.csv, risk scores and weights are derived, then four heuristics are applied: Greedy, Local Search, Simulated Annealing, and GRASP. 
Results are evaluated against the Violence column using precision, recall, lift, and yes@k. 
Run main.py to prepare data, execute all algorithms, and print summaries.
